**Vacation Expense Tracker**

**Idea**
When groups of friends go on vacation together, it's rare that each person pays for their own individual expenses. In my experience, it's far more likely for people to pay for things for each other, and then figure out how to pay each other back after the trip is all said and done.

This website will allow users to track the expenses of each person, including shared ones that have yet to be paid back. Once all the expenses have been tracked, the website will show each person what they owe each other

**MVP**

1. Users can create a new expense tracker
2. Users can add a table for each person on the vacation
3. Users can add expenses to each table
4. Expenses can be specified to be for more than just the one who made the purchase
5. Once all expenses have been added, all tables can be submitted
6. Once submitted, the website will show how much each person owes each other
